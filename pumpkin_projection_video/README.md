- **Pumpkins:** 2 carved pumpkins (medium to large size)
- **Extension Cord:** For outdoor power if needed

### Setup Steps

1. **Pumpkin Preparation:**

   - Remove all interior flesh for better light transmission
   - Position pumpkins 2-3 feet apart

2. **Projector Placement:**
   - Place projector 6-10 feet away from pumpkins
   - Adjust height so projection covers both pumpkin faces
   - Test focus and keystone correction

3. **Video Playback:**
   - Copy video file to your media player
   - Set player to loop mode for continuous playback
   - Adjust volume if using external speakers

4. **Environment:**
   - Dim or turn off nearby lights for best effect
   - Test visibility from trick-or-treater viewing angles
   - Consider weather protection for equipment

## 🔄 Looping the Video

For continuous Halloween night entertainment:

1. **Media Player Loop:** Most players have a loop/repeat function
2. **Playlist Method:** Create a playlist with the same video repeated
3. **Extended Version:** Run the generation script multiple times to create longer versions

## 🛠️ Customization

The video was generated using Python scripts that you can modify:

- **scripts/dialogue_script.py** - Edit dialogue and song lyrics
- **scripts/create_pumpkin_assets.py** - Modify pumpkin appearance
- **scripts/create_video_opencv.py** - Adjust animation timing and effects

## 🎃 Tips for Best Results

1. **Pumpkin Size:** Larger pumpkins work better for projection
